# Formatting templates

Merge these settings into the target repository's existing configuration. Review each
diff before applying it; do not overwrite configuration or run a repository-wide format
as a side effect of adopting the standard. Keep only the profiles the project uses.

The destination for `biome.template.json` is the target repository's root `biome.json`.
Its template filename prevents Biome from treating this documentation folder as a second
active project root. The other configuration files keep their names at the target root.
The schema path resolves against the target project's installed Biome package.

Illustrative tool versions for these templates are Biome 2.5.7, Prettier 3.9.6, Ruff 0.16.4
and Rust 1.98.0. They are examples, not verified latest releases or permanent requirements.
Select compatible versions for the project, pin them, commit its lockfiles, and upgrade them
through a reviewed change.

## Ownership

| Files                                                        | Authoritative formatter         | Profile       |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------- | ------------- |
| JavaScript, JSX, MJS, CJS, TypeScript, TSX, JSON, JSONC, CSS | Biome                           | Web           |
| Python                                                       | Ruff                            | Python        |
| Markdown, YAML, HTML                                         | Prettier                        | Documentation |
| Rust                                                         | rustfmt                         | Rust          |
| General whitespace and line endings                          | EditorConfig and Git attributes | Core          |

The formatter owns layout; EditorConfig makes editing agree with it, and Git attributes
keep checkout line endings consistent. Two spaces are the general indentation default;
Python and Rust use four. Makefile recipes use tabs. Preserve Markdown trailing spaces
because they may represent a line break.

The width of 100 is a formatter target, not a hard maximum for every line. Markdown
prose keeps its existing wrapping. Do not manually rewrite output accepted by the owner.

The templates deliberately assign no owner to other file types such as Svelte, Vue,
SCSS, GraphQL or TOML. A project using them must document and configure an appropriate
formatter before including them in its aggregate check. Add language-specific whitespace
exceptions, such as tabs for Go, when that profile is adopted.

Limit editor format-on-save settings to the same owners. Invoke Prettier with the
documentation globs below; a broad `prettier --write .` would also format files owned
by Biome. Generated output, dependencies, virtual environments, reports, runtimes and
model files stay outside formatting. Adjust exclusions to actual project paths and keep
the owners' ignore policies aligned; a source directory named `models` must remain
included if it contains maintained source code.

## Commands for a web repository with documentation

Merge this fragment into `package.json`; it is not a replacement manifest. Projects
without one of these profiles omit its command from the aggregate. Use project-local,
pinned tools installed through the project's documented setup.

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "format": "npm run format:web && npm run format:docs",
    "format:web": "biome format --write .",
    "format:docs": "prettier --write \"**/*.{md,yml,yaml,html}\"",
    "check:format": "npm run check:format:web && npm run check:format:docs",
    "check:format:web": "biome format .",
    "check:format:docs": "prettier --check \"**/*.{md,yml,yaml,html}\""
  }
}
```

`npm run format` writes corrections. `npm run check:format` is read-only, returns a
failure for drift and runs in CI. Keep the same active profiles in both aggregates.
Formatting is separate from linting, type checking and tests; give those their own
commands and include the relevant checks in the project's quality gate.

## Optional Python profile

Merge into `pyproject.toml`, preserving existing build, application and lint settings:

```toml
[tool.ruff]
# Set this to the oldest Python version the application supports.
target-version = "py312"
line-length = 100
extend-exclude = [
  "*.md",
  "node_modules",
  "dist",
  "build",
  "coverage",
  ".venv*",
  "venv",
  "target",
  "runtime",
  "models",
  "test-results",
  "playwright-report",
]

[tool.ruff.format]
indent-style = "space"
quote-style = "double"
line-ending = "lf"
```

The runtime minimum and release build interpreter can differ. A formatter must never
introduce syntax unsupported by the runtime minimum. Markdown is explicitly excluded
from Ruff so documentation stays with Prettier.

For repositories using a compatible interpreter resolver:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "format:python": "node tools/dev/python.mjs --needs ruff -m ruff format .",
    "check:format:python": "node tools/dev/python.mjs --needs ruff -m ruff format --check ."
  }
}
```

The resolver is project code and is not included in this template pack. Supply or adapt
it before adopting these two scripts; it must select a compatible interpreter that can
import the required module. A project's environment runner is another valid choice.
Use the same environment in the editor, terminal and CI, with the pinned Ruff installed
there. A bare `python` selected from an unverified Windows PATH is insufficient.

Add `npm run format:python` and `npm run check:format:python` to their respective
aggregates. A Python-only project can expose the same write/check distinction through
its native task runner without adding Node solely for orchestration.

## Optional Rust profile

Commit a `rust-toolchain.toml` naming an exact project-approved Rust version and the
`rustfmt` component. The source snapshot used:

```toml
[toolchain]
channel = "1.98.0"
components = ["clippy", "rustfmt"]
profile = "minimal"
```

Use the pinned rustfmt defaults unless the project needs an explicit override. The
EditorConfig Rust rule matches its four-space indentation. Merge these scripts when
Node already orchestrates the project:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "format:rust": "cargo fmt --all",
    "check:format:rust": "cargo fmt --all -- --check",
    "format": "npm run format:web && npm run format:python && npm run format:docs && npm run format:rust",
    "check:format": "npm run check:format:web && npm run check:format:python && npm run check:format:docs && npm run check:format:rust"
  }
}
```

This final example assumes all four profiles are present. Remove absent profiles from
both aggregates. A Rust-only repository can use the two Cargo commands directly.

## Adoption check

Run the read-only check with the project's installed tool versions. Review formatting
drift separately from behavior changes, run the write command when adopting the changes,
and rerun the check. CI must execute the same read-only contract. Check ignored output
paths and unsupported source file types before declaring all source files covered.

These files do not install tools, change global editor settings or migrate another
repository automatically.
